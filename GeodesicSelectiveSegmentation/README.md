# GeodesicSelectiveSegmentation

MATLAB codes for interactive geodesic selective image segmentation. 

To use you will need to extract the FastMarching zip file, and run the compile_mex.m file. Then you should be able to run the examples.

The geodesic fitting term is based on:

The intensity fitting term used is from:
